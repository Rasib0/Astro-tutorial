    <h1>... and my new Astro site!</h1>
    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutoiral. This is the second
      page on my website, and it's the first one I built one I built myself!

      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back and see how my journey is going!
