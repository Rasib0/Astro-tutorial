        <strong>Favourite Quote:</strong><em>
          "It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach
          us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little
          fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own
          answers."&mdash; Patrick Rothfuss
