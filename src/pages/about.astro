    <h1>üëã Heyyy-hello!</h1>
    <p>Rasib here, I'm a software-engineer from Pakistan.</p>
    <p>
      I am self-taught in Frontend-development and have a BS in Computer Science
      üï¥Ô∏è.
    </p>
    <p>
      My battle-tested frontend stack is Next/React with TypeScript (or Astro).
      I like using Python (fastapi), kotlin/java (springboot) for quick and
      dirty backend devolempment; I also have some experience with Rust backend
      frameworks when things require you to go <em>super</em> fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm happiest when I'm in my terminal üñ§ tinkering with my side projects
      and learning new things would help me level up.
    </p>

        <strong>Favourite Quote:</strong><em>
          "It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach
          us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little
          fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own
          answers."&mdash; Patrick Rothfuss
